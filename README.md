# Titanic Survival Prediction using Power BI

## Project Overview

This project uses Power BI to analyze and visualize the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes. The goal is to provide insights into the factors affecting passenger survival rates and to create interactive visualizations to explore the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes various features related to passengers, such as age, sex, class, and fare. The dataset can be found in the `data/` directory as `titanic.csv`.

## Features

- **Survival Prediction**: Analyze features that contribute to the likelihood of survival.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Create interactive visualizations and dashboards to explore the dataset.
- **Insights and Trends**: Identify key trends and patterns related to passenger survival.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Download Power BI Desktop**:
   - Download and install Power BI Desktop from the [official website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

2. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/msoundappan007/titanic-survival-prediction-powerbi.git
    cd titanic-survival-prediction-powerbi
    ```

3. **Open Power BI Desktop**:
   - Launch Power BI Desktop.

4. **Import the Dataset**:
   - Open the `titanic.csv` file from the `data/` directory in Power BI Desktop.
   - Go to `Home` > `Get Data` > `Text/CSV`, and select the `titanic.csv` file.

5. **Load and Transform Data**:
   - Use Power Query Editor to clean and transform the data as needed.
   - Apply necessary transformations such as handling missing values, creating new calculated columns, and encoding categorical variables.

6. **Create Visualizations**:
   - Build visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and survival heatmaps.
   - Use slicers and filters to enable interactive data exploration.

7. **Save and Publish**:
   - Save your Power BI report as a `.pbix` file.
   - Optionally, publish the report to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.

## Usage

1. **Open the Power BI Report**:
   - Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop to view the report.

2. **Explore Visualizations**:
   - Interact with the visualizations to understand how different factors affect survival rates.
   - Use slicers and filters to drill down into specific data subsets.

3. **Analyze Insights**:
   - Review the insights provided by the visualizations to understand the impact of features such as age, sex, class, and fare on survival predictions.

## Results

- **Survival Insights**: Visualize and interpret how various factors influence survival chances.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Engage with interactive dashboards to explore different aspects of the Titanic dataset.
